            <p>
              Hey, I'm Ferdi, a web developer from Italy with over five years
              experience in building web apps that run in the browser and on
              mobile devices. Currently, I'm building a tailor-made in-browser
              IDE for creating interactive online courses at
              <a href="https://datacamp.com" target="_blank">DataCamp</a>.<br />
              I have been working on this project over the course of two years
              from multiple places in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remote work gives me the freedom to work from the place I feel
              most productive in and made me and my team come up with some
              workflows that fuel focus, productivity and effective
              communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the past, while living in Austria, I have built the
              <a href="https://shop.billa.at/" target="_blank"
                >online-shop for Billa</a
              >, one of the biggest supermarket chains in the country. Other
              projects I have worked on include a web-based
              <a href="https://www.physio-vital.at/" target="_blank"
                >mobile app</a
              >
              for a global pharmaceutical company called Novartis, as well as
              websites for smaller products and companies and many personal side
              projects that mostly didn't make it to production ;-)
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from coding, I'm a very active person. I enjoy activities
              like snowboarding, scuba diving, kite surfing, riding mountain
              bikes and everything that has to do with adrenaline and speed. I
              also enjoy taking photos and videos of my adventures and edit
              them. Some of it can be seen on my Instagram,
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sifferdi/" target="_blank"
                >@sifferdi</a
              >.
            </p>
